# What is this?

This is a log of my progress as I manage this project. I've used similar logs in previous projects and I find that they help hold me more accountable. External project managment platforms exsist, but since this is a smaller project and a solo project, it will be easier for me to manage (and actually use) if the log exsists in the project.

## The Plan

Inspired by the [Thinking in React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react) page in the documentation, my plan is:

> 1. Break Down the UI into Component Hierarchy.
>    ![Diagram of Component Hierarchy](./assets/Student%20Dashboard%20Diagram-3.jpg "Component Hierarchy")
>
> 1. Create static version
>
>    1. Create header component
>    1. Create CohortList component
>    1. Create StudentList component
>    1. Style page layout
>
> 1. Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state
> 1. Identify where your state should live
> 1. Add inverse data flow

I also need to keep track of which requirements I've built/fulfilled and which I haven't:

> ### Required Features:
>
> 1. ✩ Sorted and formatted cohort list
> 1. ✩ Cohort list
> 1. ✩ Interactive cohort list
> 1. ✩ Student list
> 1. ✩ Improved student list
> 1. ✩ Additional student details
> 1. ✩ Improved student details
> 1. ✩ 1-on-1 section
> 1. ✩ Interactive 1-on-1 section
> 1. ✩ Style your application

## Reflection

I am offically finished, as of **\_\_\_** at XX:XX .

I'm really proud of **\_\_\_**.

I really struggled with **\_\_\_\_**.

My greatest take away is **\_\_\_\_**.

# Log Part 2: The Log Continues

After completing this project I challenged myself to...

- add dark mode by using useContext.
- create a reducer function
- use context to pass state/dispatch
- add animations using the animation library
- build a backend
- some other challenge
